// Peter asked his friend Max to implement a Java program in which 3 integers X, Y and N are given as a runtime input and all the numbers between X and Y which are divisible by N must be displayed on console. If no such number is possible for the given input then, print NO OUTPUT.

Input Format

3 space separated integers X, Y and N

Constraints

X, Y and N are less than 1000

X and Y are positive integers and X < Y

Output Format

All the integers between X and Y separated by space which are divisible by N

Sample Input 0

6 11 3
Sample Output 0

6 9
Sample Input 1

2 6 2
Sample Output 1

2 4 6 //

//Code
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner obj = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = obj.nextInt();
        int y = obj.nextInt();
        int n = obj.nextInt();
        boolean flag = false;
        for (int i = x; i <= y; i++) {
            if (i % n == 0) {
                System.out.print(i + " ");
                flag = true;
            }
        }
        if (!flag) {
            System.out.print("NO OUTPUT");
        }
    }
}
