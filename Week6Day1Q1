2 3 5 //

//Code
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        if (n < 10 || n > 50) {
            System.out.println("Invalid");
        } else {
            printPrimeFactors(n);
        }
    }

    public static void printPrimeFactors(int n) {
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            while (n % i == 0) {
                System.out.print(i + " ");
                n = n / i;
            }
