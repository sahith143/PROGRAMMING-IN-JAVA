Sushant and Virat are playing a game. Virat tells 2 numbers to Sushant, who need to check whether the first is bigger than second. Implement a method boolean isBigger(int a, int b) which returns true if a is bigger than b and false otherwise.

Input Format

Two space separated integer value representing numbers given by Virat

Constraints

Numbers will lie between 10 and 1000.

Output Format

true/false according to the value returned by the method or will print Invalid Input in case of numbers did not match the constraints.

Sample Input 0

50 40
Sample Output 0

true

//Code
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        if (a >= 10 && a <= 1000 && b >= 10 && b <= 1000) {
            boolean result = isBigger(a, b);
            System.out.println(result);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid Input");
        }
    }

    public static boolean isBigger(int a, int b) {
        return a > b;
    }
}
