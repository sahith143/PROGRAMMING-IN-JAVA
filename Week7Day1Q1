// Dr. Max has conducted the academic task in his class with 5 Multiple Choice Questions each having 4 options A/B/C/D. He wanted to write a program which can evaluate the test papers of all the N students such that each correct answer is awarded 1 mark and for incorrect answer penalty is 0.25 marks.

The program must read the number of students N and the the answers of all the N students in the form of a String. If any question is not attempted by any student, then X should be given as input corresponding to that question e.g. ABAXD

It is expected that the marks of all the N students are displayed separated by SPACE.

Input Format

First Line of the input reads the String of CORRECT ANSWERS

Second Line of the input reads the number of students N

Next N lines read the answer Strings of the N students respectively.

Constraints

N > 0

Input characters can be either in Upper Case or Lower Case

Else "Incorrect Input"

Output Format

Print the marks of all the N students separated by SPACE

Sample Input 0

ACBDC
2
BCXDX
AXXDC
Sample Output 0

1.75 3.0 //

            } else {
                totalMarks -= 0.25;
            }
