// Mrs. Jhunjhunwala has taught Programming in Java to the second-year students in ICE college and conducted 3 academic tasks for all the (N) students. Marks are store in a 2-D array but now Mrs. Jhunjhunwala is willing to implement a java program which can accept the 2-D array of marks and return the average marks of Best 2 Academic Tasks of each student. Help her to implement a method public double[] average_marks(double [][] marks)

Input Format

First line reads the number of students N Next N lines read the marks of each student seperated by space

Constraints

n>0

Output Format

Prints the Avaerage marks of best 2 Academic tasks of N students separated by space

Sample Input 0

2
10.5 2.5 15
5.25 6.75 11.25
Sample Output 0

12.75 9.0 //
